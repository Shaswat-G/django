# üß† Understanding Django & Web Development Fundamentals (Python-centric)

## üîß What is Django?

Django is a **high-level, open-source web framework** written in Python that enables rapid development of secure and maintainable websites. It follows the **"batteries included"** philosophy ‚Äî meaning it ships with a comprehensive set of features needed to build robust applications, without reinventing the wheel.

### Key Highlights:
- Reduces boilerplate: build powerful apps **faster** with **fewer lines of code**.
- **Adopted by industry leaders**: Used by YouTube, Instagram, Spotify, and Dropbox in their stacks.
- Prioritizes **convention over configuration**, making it ideal for developers who want a ready-made toolbox.
- Emphasizes **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)** and **MTV (Model-Template-View)** architecture.

## üî¢ Python Web Framework Market Share (approximate):
- **Django** ‚Äì 45%
- **Flask** ‚Äì 35%
- **Others** (Tornado, Bottle, Falcon, Hug, etc.) ‚Äì 20%

## üß∞ Django‚Äôs ‚ÄúBatteries Included‚Äù Features

Django provides a rich toolkit out of the box:
1. **Admin Interface**: Automatically generated backend dashboard for managing app data.
2. **Object-Relational Mapper (ORM)**: Pythonic way to interact with databases.
3. **Authentication System**: Secure user management ‚Äî login, signup, permissions.
4. **Caching Framework**: Built-in support for optimizing performance through caching.

> You don‚Äôt have to build these from scratch ‚Äî you can focus on **business logic**, not plumbing.

## üß™ Why Choose Django?

- **Mature ecosystem**: Over a decade of battle-testing.
- **Vast community**: Extensive third-party packages, tutorials, and forums.
- **Pluggability**: Most components can be learned and integrated independently.
- **Scalability**: Suitable for both MVPs and production-scale deployments.
- **Stability**: Django's release process and backwards compatibility ensure long-term reliability.

## üåê Web Development Basics: Frontend vs Backend

| Aspect      | Frontend                            | Backend                                |
|-------------|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Runs on     | Client device (browser, app)        | Server                                 |
| Purpose     | UI/UX, rendering, user interaction  | Data processing, logic, API handling   |
| Tech stack  | HTML, CSS, JS, React/Vue/Angular    | Python (Django), JS (Express), C# (.NET Core) |

## üîÅ What Happens When a User Visits a Website?

1. User types a URL or clicks a link.
2. **DNS** (Domain Name System) resolves domain to an **IP address**.
3. **HTTPS** (secured HTTP) sends the request to the server.
4. The server:
   - Parses the request
   - Performs **CRUD** operations on the database
   - Sends back a **response** (HTML or JSON)
5. The browser either renders the **HTML** directly or uses JS frameworks to render the data client-side.

## üß© APIs: Your Server‚Äôs Remote Control

- Servers **expose endpoints** (e.g., `/products`, `/orders`) ‚Äî these are called **APIs**.
- APIs let clients (browsers, apps, etc.) **interact** with the server‚Äôs data or functionality.
- Types of APIs:
  - **RESTful** ‚Äì stateless, resource-based
  - **GraphQL** ‚Äì flexible, query-based

Learning Django involves understanding how to build and expose these APIs using views, serializers, and routing systems.

## ‚úÖ Final Thoughts

Performance is just one metric. What matters more for developers:
- Framework **maturity**
- **Learning curve** and documentation
- **Community size** and support
- Ecosystem of **plugins and integrations**

Django shines by delivering a well-rounded, production-ready solution ‚Äî ideal for startups, solo developers, and enterprise teams alike.

Install django on with your fav package manager and code editor for your setup.
I use windows 11 with miniconda and vs code on sterod with useful extensions.

create a folder directory, initilaise a git repo, create a github repo with readmes and .gitignore and license
then run django-admin startproject storefront {expand on the most commonly used django comamnds and their uses}



{expand in detail the components fo this files and what is each meant for, what ir does}
init file is for defiing the folder as a package
settings for application settinfs
urls for urls of the application
asgi and wsgi is for deployment 


from now on we will use manage.py (instead of djangod-admin) which takes in to account the settings of the application
python manage.py runserver - click on the server and see.


Each django proejct is different since the functioanlity and use cases of an app dicate its design and implementation
