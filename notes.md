# Basics of Web dev

Front end (loaded in a UI witht the client computer - apps, deskopt, browse) vd Bcak End (server, data processing, etc)

WHen a client makes a request through the browser (by clicking a button or typing a domain name)
the DNS converts it to a valid IP
Borwsers use HTTPs (secured with TLS or SSL) over Http (text based, unsecure) to send a query (what str and how is dictated by the backend)
The sever gets the request processes information, crud databases and responds usually with a json object. APIs are usually either RESTful or GraphQL.
One way is to create an html response, send the html document to the client / or send the data that is rendered at the client (we can free up to serve more clients, industry best practive, scalable)

the html can be rendered on the client side using react, angular and vue.

backend frameworks are django, express (JS), asp.net core (C#)

Server is the gateway to get and interact with data. We can expose endpoints (with APIs or entities that clietns can itneract wtih) /products, /orders, all these endpoints are used for the client to talk to the server called APIs - buttons on a remote control - for us to interact with.

And we have to learn how to build these APIs.
